<a name="acetylcholine" class="anchor" href="#acetylcholine"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>09/26/2013 - 14:35 - Feature: Neuroscience: Acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase.</h3>

<p>The recent use of Sarin gas in Syria brings to mind the functions of acetylcholine (ACh) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Why would Sarin gas bring these things to mind? Thatâ€™s because both play a critical role in bodily function. The use of Sarin gas causes changes that are fundamental to the actions of ACh and AChE. Normally, ACh is released at cholinergic synapses to stimulate cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.</p>

<p>AChE is released at the synapse in order to break down ACh in the synapse to prevent overstimulation of the neurons. But, when Sarin is present, the chemical binds irreversibly to the pre- and post-synaptic choline neurons at the site where AChE is released. This means that the release of AChE is blocked, and an overflow of ACh enters the synapse, causing overstimulation of the neurons.</p>

<p>The presence of too much ACh in the synaptic space leads to uncontrollable muscular movements, paralysis, and death. Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) can be used before a person is exposed to Sarin, although this would mean that a person would know about such an attack ahead of time in order to take precautionary measures.</p>
